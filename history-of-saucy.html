<h1>2009</h1>   
<p>
    ​On June 26, 2009 the YouTube channel 96TennisAce was created for the purpose of fake falling & slingshot videos. Fast forward a few years, and the channel was renamed to Saucy Saturday, to create inspirational & entertaining vlogs. Because it's important to relax in life, but also be inspired to be better. The websites 96tennisace.net and saucysaturday.com were both created to promote the YouTube channel. Also, Saucy Saturday created its own Patreon page so that its fans could support it.

<h1>2014</h1>
<p>
    The inspirational side of creating YouTube videos started to form this sense of a "greater community", so Saucy was created a Slack group and added a ton of discussion boards to it. In fact, 2,400+ to create a network where anyone could talk about anything at any time. It's different than a social network, because everyone is talking in the same user interface, just in different rooms. 
</p>

<h1>2015</h1>
<p>
    A community has to have values, right? After several days of brainstorming, Saucy decided that "Support diversity. Think positively. Love unconditionally."  would be the values it wanted to communicate to make a difference in the world. Like a mindset, that people can apply to every day situations, to create the best outcomes possible for their relationships, health, wealth, and happiness.

<h1>2017</h1>
<p>
    Realizing YouTube wasn't going to be enough to run a company on, Saucy moved off Patreon and started to put rewards on the website, like access to the Slack group for those who supported Saucy on YouTube. On July 16th, 2016 Saucy officially started as a business at Sauc.io (later to be renamed Saucy.io), with different rewards under categories called sectors. Later on, the community rewards were added. Life is all about who you are, and where you fit into the greater community.

Instead of the whole app being in one unified dashboard, it is all on various pages. This is great for SEO as well as creating a fantastic experience.
