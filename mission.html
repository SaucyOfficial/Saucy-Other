<h1>Mission</h1>
<br><p>Saucy is built with a strong foundation on diversity, which consists of acceptance, open-mindedness, gentleness, and encouragement. We welcome everyone with loving arms, and show positivity through our encouraging words and actions. Everyone is welcome, no matter who they are, what their interests are, or what they've been through. We believe in the power of community to create a better tomorrow. 
<br><br>
Why is diversity so important and such an essential part of living the most amazing life? Everything is in diversity. The whole world is full of diversity, everything you see, smell, taste, hear, and feel. True diversity is not diversity without everything inside of it. Nowhere in the world will you ever find somewhere everyone is truly welcome. 
<br><br>
Look at the stars, what do you see? Galaxies, planets, and outer space. There is even an unknown universe outside of the known universe! The universe is infinitely large, and just like it has no end, neither does diversity. Open-mindedness is the key to the good life.
<br><br>
The most beautiful thing in life itself is giving to other people, whether that's through helping someone in need, or being kind with your words. Saucy is all about giving back to the community. We talk to each other without saying the words "I don't know you". This is not a small community. It is intended for the entire world to join, so please, talk to as many people as you can. The more you talk to, the more you learn, and the more friends you'll make.
<br><br>
Culture and history have a huge impact on diversity. I encourage you to learn from other cultures, and visit many museums, especially art museums. Art is a gateway to the creative side of the brain, which allows you to think creatively. Thinking creatively leads to a shift in your mind thinking about new things. 
<br><br>
Why is this community called Saucy? Simply, the answer is: Being Saucy is all about having a mind that flows like sauce, never rigid in shape nor direction. Diversity is king, and without it, you cannot be positive or loving. Through diversity, all things are made equal.
