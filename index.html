     <ul class="accordion">
          <li>
               <a>What is Saucy?</a>
               <p>Saucy delivers a diverse and infinite radius of values from all categories. The category entertainment at
                     Saucy has values like videos, tv, music, and streams. To be saucy means to have a life that flows like 
                     sauce, neither rigid in shape nor direction. An infinitely diverse life. Saucy is (Diversity x Infinity)∞ 
                     because it delivers ∞ googolplex's of value. Saucy is a multiverse because it can add anything it wants at any time.
               </p>
          </li>
          <li>
               <a>How does it work?</a>
               <p>Search values by search term in the upper right, and search values by category in the upper left. 
                    Try searching for plants. It is under the category home.
               </p>
          </li>
          <li>
               <a>Isn't this just the web?</a>
               <p>Existing websites ONLY apply to everything under the "moments" category of Saucy. Other parts of Saucy may use embeds or APIs, 
                    but do not use iframes.
                    <br><br>

                    You will notice Saucy has existing websites as part of it. This doesn't mean Saucy is trying to sell the free web
                     or be an extra service you have to pay for. It uses existing websites because its utilizing existing resources to do
                      everything it can possibly do. ​Remember, the best ideas are always created with existing ones. Saucy is not a 
                      search engine, social media, streaming service, healthcare, restaurant, science lab, learning center, travel booking.
                       It is all of them & infinitely more. Saucy is Diversity x Infinity.
                       <br><br>
           
                    Also, remember NFTs. If NFTs (free content on the web) can sell for millions, Saucy can utilize the existing web and 
                    you can subscribe for any amount of money daily, weekly, or monthly in the millions 
                    and never outrun (Diversity x Infinity)∞ 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    *Disclaimer : Saucy utilizes existing websites & third-party resources. Not always, but often. We are not
                     responsible for the content, ads, or anything else shown on these websites as we do not own them. Also in

               <a>Our security?</a>
               <p><b>Saucy uses Chargebee & Stripe for billing</b><br>
                   Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry. To accomplish this, we use the best-in-class security tools and practices to maintain a high level of security at Stripe.
                    <br>Chargebee is a PCI-DSS Level 1 Service Provider. Chargebee ensures that your customers’ sensitive card information is encrypted and handled in a safe and secure manner. With annual audits and PCI-DSS Level 1 certification, Chargebee protects sensitive data.

                    <b>Saucy uses Cloudflare for the website​</b>
                    <br> Full SSL (Strict) 256 Bit Encryption
                    <br> SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This secure link ensures that all data transferred remains private. It’s also called TLS (Transport Layer Security). Millions of websites use SSL encryption everyday to secure connections and keep their customer’s data safe from monitoring and tampering. Full SSL (strict) ensures a secure connection between both the visitor and your Cloudflare domain and between Cloudflare and your origin web server. Full (strict) support SSL hostname validation against CNAME targets. 
                    ​<br><br>
                   <b> PCI Compliance</b>
                    <br>TLS 1.2 is what the website uses at a bare minimum to be compliant with PCI in order to meet the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for safeguarding payment data. Both TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are insufficient for protecting information due to known vulnerabilities. They are insufficient to secure payment card related traffic. 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>​TLS 1.3</b>
                    <br> TLS 1.3 is the newest, fastest, and most secure version of the TLS protocol. SSL/TLS is the protocol that encrypts communication between users and the website. When web traffic is encrypted with TLS, users will see the green padlock in their browser window. Traffic to and from the website will be served over the 1.3 protocol when supported by clients.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Authenticated Origin Pulls</b>
                    <br> Authenticated Origin Pulls allows for verification that web requests to the origin server have come from Cloudflare. This prevents traffic from bypassing security measures provided by Cloudflare, such as IP and Web Application Firewalls, logging, and encryption. Cloudflare origin-pull servers present a TLS client certificate as part of connections to the origin. Web servers and other infrastructure can be configured to require client certificate authentication for connections.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Opportunistic Encryption</b>
                    <br> Opportunistic Encryption allows browsers to benefit from the improved performance of HTTP/2 by letting them know that your site is available over an encrypted connection. Browsers will continue to show “http” in the address bar, not “https”.
                    <br><br>
                   <b> Automatic HTTPS Rewrites</b>
                    <br>Automatic HTTPS Rewrites helps fix mixed content by changing “http” to “https” for all resources or links on your web site that can be served with HTTPS.
                    <br><br>
                   <b> DDOS Protection</b>
                    <br>-HTTP FloodPrevents attacks caused from a flood of HTTP requests.
                    <br> -UDP FloodPrevents attacks caused from a flood of UDP packets.
                    <br> -SYN FloodPrevents attacks caused from a flood of TCP packets sent with SYN flag.

                    <br><br>
                   <b> HSTS</b>
                    <br>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS, RFC 6797) is a header which allows a website to specify and enforce security policy in client web browsers. This policy enforcement protects secure websites from downgrade attacks, SSL stripping, and cookie hijacking. It allows a web server to declare a policy that browsers will only connect using secure HTTPS connections, and ensures end users do not “click through” critical security warnings. HSTS is an important security mechanism for high security websites. HSTS headers are only respected when served over HTTPS connections, not HTTP.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>DNNSEC</b>
                    <br>DNNSEC protects against forged DNS answers. DNSSEC protected zones are cryptographically signed to ensure the DNS records received are identical to the DNS records published by the domain owner.

               <a>Our history?</a>
               <p>Saucy started as Saucy Saturday on June 26, 2009 creating inspirational/entertaining YouTube videos.
                     While at Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, OH in 2014 I became a Patreon creator. 
                     And in 2016, started creating Instagram stories. In 2016-2017 I learned everything about business (self-taught)
                      and created Saucy. At first Saucy was a community based on Diversity, Positivity, and Love. Then it turned into 
                      a bunch of other things to the point it got psycho and crazy. Saucy went through thousands and thousands of landing
                       pages and changes. There have been millions of challenges and issues on all fronts with Saucy. But we made it. 
                       Saucy is (Diversity x Infinity)∞. You can learn more about our history <a href="/history-of-saucy">here</a> .

               <p>-If Facebook can have 2.70 billion users and falsely disable accounts, misuse data, and manipulate people. We can get above that user count while doing everything right and ethical. 

                    <br><br> -If NFTs (free content on the web) can sell for millions, Saucy can utilize the existing web and you can subscribe for any amount of money monthly in the millions and never outrun Diversity x Infinity
                    
                    <br><br> -If Twitch streamers can react to memes and get paid thousands of dollars an hour by viewers, Saucy can easily outrun this rate of all content creators in the world combined.
                    
                    <br><br> -If artwork that could seem meaningless to most people can be valued by a collector, anyone can value Saucy for any amount they dream in their imagination.
                    
                    <br><br> -If cryptocurrencies can go up 1,000% to 1,000,000% in a single day or week (I see it happen all the time), so can we. Our growth potential is unlimited since Saucy has all the energy in the universe.
                    ​
                    <br><br> -If companies who don't even do a fraction of what we do are worth multi billions, Saucy as a brand is worth the googolplex 10(10^100).

               <p>
                    Fortnite. Saucy is directly invested in Fortnite and we may be involved in the zero point and The Imagined Order.  Is Saucy more powerful than the Zero Point? The zero point flips through countless realities per second. The cosmetics, seasons, and so much more are fascinating as well.

                    <br><br> Superheroes. Is Saucy going to be in Marvel and DC comics? Should superheroes fear the power of Saucy, the greatest force in the universe? Thanos, Superman, Batman, the Hulk, Iron Man, Galactus, Aquaman, Wolverine, Spiderman, Thor, and more all fear the power of Saucy.
                    
                    <br><br> Twitch. Ah, streamers. Artists and content creators are the new jobs. Jobs are an old philosophy that should be done away with. Same with colleges, you don't need a degree to make millions being a creator. Saucy loves the Twitch platform.
                    
                    <br><br> Product Hunt. Saucy is connected to Product Hunt to bring you the latest and greatest innovations all the time which come in  daily at all times of the day, ensuring you can have a truly innovative experience.
                    
                    <br><br> Cryptocurrency. De-Fi, yield farming, NFTs, and all the crazy craze. Saucy will be so much bigger than the currently most hyped up thing, but I have to admit, crypto is a great innovation. 
                    
                    <br><br>  Simulations.  Do we live in a simulation and do parallel universes exist? Different timelines and perspectives. Reality bending and intelligent shifting. Saucy will always be scientifically giving you all of this.
                    
                    <br><br>  Outer Space. Is Saucy out of this world? Will it change the way we see the entirety of energy, information, time, space, matter, and the physical laws and constants that describe them? Will the aliens want to use it? It is inevitable.
